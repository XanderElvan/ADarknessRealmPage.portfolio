            <p class="stanza">
                Below you are twenty questions you can use to get to know one of your characters better. Above you, you will find three different soundscapes, each capturing the atmosphere from one of The Darkness Realm’s worlds. <br> <br>

                We invite you to experiment with any combination of the questions and sounds offered here, to see if this can ignite new ideas, or reveal more depth to one of your pre-existing characters. <br> <br>

                There is no, ‘right way’ to go about this, if one of the soundscapes speaks to you, you might find yourself having a conversation with a new character that lives there. You might disregard the soundscapes altogether, instead taking this opportunity to sit down with one of your characters and get to know them a little better.  <br>
